Portfolio for Gregory Williams

This personal portfolio serves as compilaton of pojects done or partaked in by Gregory Williams. This website was developed using HTML, along with CSS elements and attributes. During this process, I:

* Used semnatic HTML attributes
* Orginized elements in logical structure
* Used flex box to position images
* Took advantage of the Dev feature in chrome to test webpage
* Linked projects to deployed sites
* Made clear comments on both HTNL and CSS
* Commited often to GitHub repository

Developing this webpage I spent an extensive amount of time using flex box attributes, and increased my knowledge on how it functions.
